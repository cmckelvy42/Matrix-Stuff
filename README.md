# Matrix-Stuff
stuff I've made to go along with my Linear Algebra studies

Currently contains a basic Matrix class that can do matrix addition and multiplication.
Multiplication could be done better with the data stored as a double int pointer to allow for array multiplication, but since the point is to demonstrate an understanding of how matrix multiplication actually works, I did things the long way.
Also there's no validation when passing an existing data table to ensure that all row vectors are the same size, obviously this would need to exist in a real product.
