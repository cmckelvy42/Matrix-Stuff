# Matrix-Stuff
stuff I've made to go along with my Linear Algebra studies

Currently contains a basic Matrix class that can do matrix addition and multiplication.
no validation when passing an existing data table to ensure that all row vectors are the same size, obviously this would need to exist in a real product.
